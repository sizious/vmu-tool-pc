Welcome to VMU TOOL PC

VMU TOOL PC is a cool Windows-Like explorer which allows you to manage Dreamcast's saves on your PC. 

It's a cool add-on for VMU TOOL avialable on Dreamcast. You can get all information you want, such VMU icons, copyright, size, etc, modify these information, and much more. Currently, this program supports VMS+VMI files and DCI (Nexus) files.
